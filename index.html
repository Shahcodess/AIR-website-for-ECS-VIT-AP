            <h2>Welcome to the AIR Lab of VIT AP</h2>
            <p>The <b id="bold"> AIR (Artificial Intelligence and Robotics)</b> Center is an initiative brought to reality in VIT AP University 
               and is the first of its kind in the country.Set up with the aim of learning about the latest technologies
               of the field like Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Robotics,the AIR Lab has given students a platform
               to not only learn about them but also work with them to build something unique.
            </p>
            <p>The lab makes an ideal technology-rich environment to promote student-driven learning and provides a new approach to learning rather than the customary way. In the two years of its establishment, the lab has grown with more students coming in with unique ideas worth working on. With the support of the faculty, the aim is to be a place of harmony for ideas and the latest technologies and make them a reality. One of the remarkable projects is VISU, India's first academic low-cost 3D printed Humanoid robot. The lab is currently led by Dr. Sibi Chakkaravarthy and his team. The projects which are completed in AIR Research center are listed below.</p>
